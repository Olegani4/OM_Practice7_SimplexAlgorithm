# Simplex Algorithm

This software takes the input file of 
Linear Programming problem and after
calculations writes the output file,
where are provided the all steps of
calculations with the maximum value 
of an objective function.





## Structure of the input file

Values should be tab-separated; 
lines should be separated by a 
system-specific line separator.
